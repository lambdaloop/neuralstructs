title: "About Neural Structures"
---

A commonly repeated trope is that we know very little about how our brain works.
What's going on in there when we look around? When we talk? When we listen to music? How do we remember things? How do we forget?

Although generally higher mechanisms are not fully understood, a lot of basic processing has been mapped out. However, the maps are rarely presented in full, with all the context needed to understand them.

*The aim of this site is to clearly present the neural mechanisms underlying basic functions.*

For each function, I will give a description of it and describe both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the neural mechanisms. 

* The _functional_ descriptions will include case studies of people missing the function and simple experiments you can perform to help understand it.

* The _qualitative_ description will assume no or limited background in physiology, so that the role of each system will be explained, with  pictures.

* The _quantitative_ description will assume some background in math and computing, but will be separated from the rest.
